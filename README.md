ABP provides a **full stack developer experience**.



### Architecture

<img src="docs/en/images/ddd-microservice-simple.png">

ABP offers a complete, **modular** and **layered** software architecture based on **[Domain Driven Design](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/architecture/domain-driven-design)** principles and patterns. It also provides the necessary infrastructure and guidance to [implement this architecture](https://abp.io/books/implementing-domain-driven-design).

ABP Framework is suitable for **[microservice solutions](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/architecture/microservices)** as well as monolithic applications.



### Infrastructure

There are a lot of features provided by the ABP Framework to achieve real-world scenarios easier, like [Event Bus](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/infrastructure/event-bus), [Background Job System](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/infrastructure/background-jobs), [Audit Logging](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/infrastructure/audit-logging), [BLOB Storing](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/infrastructure/blob-storing), [Data Seeding](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/infrastructure/data-seeding), [Data Filtering](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/infrastructure/data-filtering), etc.



### Cross-Cutting Concerns

ABP also simplifies (and even automates wherever possible) cross-cutting concerns and common non-functional requirements like [Exception Handling](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/fundamentals/exception-handling), [Validation](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/fundamentals/validation), [Authorization](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/fundamentals/authorizationn), [Localization](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/fundamentals/localization), [Caching](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/fundamentals/caching), [Dependency Injection](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/fundamentals/dependency-injection), [Setting Management](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/infrastructure/settings), etc.



### Application Modules

ABP is a modular framework and the Application Modules provide **pre-built application functionalities**;

- [**Account**](https://abp.io/docs/latest/modules/account): Provides UI for the account management and allows user to login/register to the application.
- **[Identity](https://abp.io/docs/latest/modules/identity)**: Manages organization units, roles, users and their permissions based on the Microsoft Identity library.
- [**OpenIddict**](https://abp.io/docs/latest/modules/openiddict): Integrates to OpenIddict.
- [**Tenant Management**](https://abp.io/docs/latest/modules/tenant-management): Manages tenants for a [multi-tenant](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/architecture/multi-tenancy) (SaaS) application.
